Determine the indefinite article of an English term.

An indefinite article is the word that comes before nouns or noun equivalents in English, such as "_a_" or "_an_". If the word starts with a consonant sound, the article used should be "_a_" — for example "banana" becomes "_a_ banana". If the word starts with a vowel sound, the article used should be "_an_" — for example "apple" becomes "_an_ apple".

This is not as simple as checking whether the first character of the word is a vowel or consonant as that does not determine the sound pronounced when speaking the word.

This is a port of [Eamon Nerbonne's original solution](https://github.com/EamonNerbonne/a-vs-an) for the problem.

## 💾 Installation

As the original maintainer appears to have abandoned the project, its a manual install I'm afraid, unless I publish this on packagist.

Add the following to your projects `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/othyn/php-indefinite-article.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "imliam/php-indefinite-article": "dev-php8"
    }
}
```

Then run the following command so that Composer can pull the package and update your lockfile:

```bash
composer update
```

## 📝 Usage

``` php
$word = new ImLiam\IndefiniteArticle\IndefiniteArticle('apple');

echo $word->parse();
// "an apple"

echo $word->article();
// "an"
```

## ✅ Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
